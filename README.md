<h1>Simple Calculator</h1>
<p>This is a simple calculator project that i wanted to build in order to hone my skills as a javascript developer. Here a learned more about javascript: How to avoid the use of global variables which is a valuable skill as doing this minimize future problems with those varibles, like changing the value of one of them by mistake. I also improved my use of functions it's not the best, but it's a little better than before, learned a new Math method, the Math.round(). And a few more minor things that i've used to build the site so far, although the site isn't finished, having with some major display errors that i want to fix, it's working, so feel free to use if you want. I intend to add keyboard features to this one, after i fix the display.</p>
