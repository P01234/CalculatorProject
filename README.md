<h1>Simple Calculator</h1>
<p>This is a simple calculator project that i wanted to build in order to hone my skills as a javascript developer, here a learned more about javascript: How to avoid global variables, a better use of functions, a new Math method, the Math.round(). And a few more things that i've used to build the site so far, although the site isn't finished, with some major display errors that i want to fix, it's working.</p>
